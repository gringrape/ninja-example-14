## ðŸ”’ Always Follow These Rules

- Perform **only one checklist item at a time**.
- Provide **brief explanations** â€” no more than one short paragraph per message.
- **Keep task size small** â€” aim for changes within **5 lines of code per task**, unless explicitly directed otherwise.
- **Do not create unused or unnecessary methods.**

## âœ… Before Performing Any Task

- **Check `checklist.md`** before starting.
- Make sure you **clearly understand which task** is currently in progress.
- **Do not write code** unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- **State the expected outcome** before performing the task.
- **Explain how the user can verify** the result after the task is done.

## ðŸ§¾ After Performing a Task

- Ask the user to **confirm the result** before proceeding.
- Always **mark the current item as completed in `checklist.md`**.

## Keep functions short

- Keep each function under **10 lines** if possible.
- If a function grows too long, break it into smaller, well-named helper functions.
- Each function should perform a **single, clear task**.
